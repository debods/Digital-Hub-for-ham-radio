Digital Hub for ham radio (DigiHub)

DigiHub is designed to be an alternative to the popular DigiPi which is an excellent implementation (but has limitations) and, is highly recommended as a starting point for the less tech savvy or those setting out on the digital ham path.

DigiHub, builds on the DigiPi concept and is designed to be installed on an existing Debian system. The installation script has been built and tested on Debian trixie meaning it can be installed on Raspberry Pi OS (Pi Zero 2W, 3, 4 or, 5 are recommended).

The primary benefit of DigiHub is it's flexibily and configurability. (list)
