Digital Hub for ham radio (DigiHub)

DigiHub is designed to be an alternative to the popular DigiPi which is an excellent implementation (but has limitations) and, is highly recommended as a starting point for the less tech savvy or those setting out on the digital ham road.

DigiHub, builds on the DigiPi concept and is designed to allow it to be installed on an existing Debian system.

The primary benefit of DigiHub is it's flexibily and configurability.

The installation script has been built and tested on Debian trixie meaning it can be installed on Raspberry Pi OS (Pi Zero 2W, 3, 4 or, 5 are recommended).

A number of the methods uses to install, run and maintain DigiHub have been made into command line utilities:

aprspass    -   Generate your APRS password

checkcall   -   Check a callsign using the hamdb API

dwsetup     -   Install, or update and existing installation of, Direwolf

hamgrid     -   Get you Maidenhead ham grid from latitude and longitude

sysinfo     -   System information

There are other useful tools located in DigiHub/scripts.
